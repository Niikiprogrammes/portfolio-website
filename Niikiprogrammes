    <h2>Listen Up!</h2>
    <p> 
       I currently attend Lambda School where i am studying to 
       be a Software Engineer.
       Start Date: July 2019
       End Date:   December 2020 
       Ive been wanting to join the Technology Rollercoaster 
       for about 4 years. I knew what i wanted to do, I just needed to 
       be at the right place at the right time. And that day came 
       quicker than i thought it would. You'd think waiting for years
       for the right opportunity would be crazy, but for me its all the 
       time i needed. When i applied at Lambda it seemed as if i only
       waited a day. Today, I am exactly where i want to be in life, I know 
       which company i want to work for and where i'd like to relocate.
       This Is it!
